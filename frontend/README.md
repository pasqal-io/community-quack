#Analog Neutral Atom Compiler

A cross-platform desktop application for compiling Ising Hamiltonians into Pasqal pulser sequences. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for researchers and developers working with neutral atom quantum computers, simplifying the process of translating a theoretical model into a hardware-compatible pulse sequence.

✨ Key Features
Ising Hamiltonian Input: Define your quantum system using the familiar Ising model format.

Pasqal Pulse Generation: Automatically compiles the model into a valid sequence for Pasqal's pulser library.

High-Performance Backend: Core compilation logic is written in Go for speed and efficiency.

Modern GUI: A sleek and responsive user interface built with Wails and Svelte.

Cross-Platform: Build and run the application on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

🏛️ Architecture
This application leverages the power of Wails to create a bridge between a Go backend and a Svelte web-based frontend.

Frontend (Svelte): The frontend/ directory contains the Svelte application. It is responsible for rendering the UI components, managing user input, and displaying the results. It makes calls to the Go backend for the core compilation logic.

Backend (Go): The main.go file and other .go source files contain the application's core logic. This includes:

Parsing and validating the input Ising Hamiltonian.

Implementing the compilation algorithm to map Hamiltonian coefficients to pulse parameters (amplitude, detuning, duration).

Exposing methods that can be called directly from the Svelte frontend.

Wails Bridge: Wails handles the communication between the frontend and backend, allowing you to call Go functions from JavaScript and vice-versa. It also manages window creation, menus, and bundling the application into a single executable.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

Prerequisites
You must have the following tools installed on your system:

Go (version 1.18 or newer)

Node.js (LTS version)

Wails CLI: Follow the official installation guide at wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/analog-neutral-atom-compiler.git
cd analog-neutral-atom-compiler

Build the application:
The Wails CLI will handle all dependencies and compile the application into a single executable for your platform.

wails build

The executable will be located in the build/bin/ directory.

🕹️ How to Use
Launch the application.

Enter your Ising Hamiltonian parameters into the input text area on the left. See the required format below.

Click the "Compile" button.

The generated Pasqal pulser sequence will appear in the output panel on the right. You can use the "Copy" button to copy it to your clipboard.

Input: Ising Model
The compiler expects the Ising model to be defined in a simple JSON format. The JSON object should contain keys for the external magnetic field (h) and the coupling strengths (J).

h: A map where keys are atom indices (as strings) and values are the local field coefficients.

J: A map where keys are comma-separated pairs of atom indices (e.g., "0,1") and values are the coupling strengths.

Example Input:

{
  "h": {
    "0": 0.5,
    "1": -0.3,
    "2": 0.2
  },
  "J": {
    "0,1": 1.0,
    "1,2": -0.8
  }
}

Output: Pulser Sequence
The output is a Python code snippet that uses the pulser library to declare the pulse sequence. This can be directly integrated into your quantum computing scripts.

Example Output:

from pulser import Pulse, Sequence, Register

# Define atom register (assuming a simple layout)
qubits = {"0": (0, 0), "1": (0, 5), "2": (5, 0)}
reg = Register(qubits)

seq = Sequence(reg, PasqalDevice)

# Define Pulse
# This part is generated by the compiler
# Example: a simple global pulse
pulse = Pulse.ConstantPulse(
    duration=1000, 
    amplitude=3.5, 
    detuning=-2.5, 
    phase=0
)

seq.add(pulse, "global")

# You can now draw or simulate the sequence
# seq.draw()

💻 For Developers
If you want to contribute to the development, you can run the application in live development mode. This provides hot-reloading for both the Go backend and the Svelte frontend.

Navigate to the project directory:

cd analog-neutral-atom-compiler

Run the development server:

wails dev

The application will launch, and any changes you make to the Go or Svelte source files will be automatically reloaded.
